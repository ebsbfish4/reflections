When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This prevents any disasterous computer erros that would result in a loss of the program.
It will also allow groups to work together much easier

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This can allow you to work on different things and not neccessarily
be interuppted by changes different people make.
