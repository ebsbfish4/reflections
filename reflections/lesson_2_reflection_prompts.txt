What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It makes everything in that folder part of a repository in git. 
This does not, however, create the initial commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It allows you to only add some of the files. This is useful
because it can help you keep logical changes seperate. One 
example could be that you make changes to a game that update
the updates the stylesheet of multiple classes and creates 
a new class you can save them as different commits.

 How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

 You can make sure that the files changes make logical sense
 together, and if not you can seperate them into two commits.

 What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

 Branches should help you keep different tracks of a code.
 You need to have one master that stays updated, and then you
 can also have different branches for experimental features, 
 different versions, entirely different features, etc.

 How do diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

 You can visualize different branches with particular 
 focus on where the head of each node is.

 What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

 It combines the changes both people made to the codebase 
and seperating it like that helps us see it better
